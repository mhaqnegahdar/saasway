## Overview

**SaaSWay** is an AI-powered platform that helps **non-technical founders** transform raw SaaS ideas into structured, build-ready project blueprints.

The platform guides founders through the process of:

* Defining their idea and MVP scope
* Recommending the right tech stack
* Estimating timelines and complexity
* Identifying potential technical risks
* Generating an actionable roadmap for development

The goal: give founders clarity before they write a single line of code — and connect them with trusted developers or agencies to build it when ready.

---

## Core Value Proposition

> “Turn your SaaS idea into a build-ready roadmap in minutes — without learning to code.”

---

## Scope – MVP Features

* AI-powered **Idea Analysis** → Converts a plain-English idea into project summary
* AI-generated **Feature Breakdown** (Core / Optional / Future)
* Automated **Tech Stack Recommendation** (Next.js, Supabase, etc.)
* **Complexity & Timeline Estimation** (Low, Medium, High)
* AI-driven **Risk Report** (technical + product)
* **Downloadable Project Brief** (PDF)
* Authentication (optional for MVP)
* Project history stored locally or in DB

---

## System Overview (Tech Stack)

* **Type:** Web Application (Desktop-First, Responsive)
* **Frontend:** Next.js + shadcn/ui + TailwindCSS
* **Backend:** Next.js (API Routes) + tRPC
* **Database:** PostgreSQL (NeonDB)
* **ORM:** Drizzle ORM
* **AI Engine:** OpenAI GPT-4o API
* **Queue/Jobs:** Inngest (background processing)
* **Auth (optional MVP):** Better Auth
* **Hosting:** Vercel

---

## Functional Requirements

1. **Idea Input & Analysis**

   * Founder submits SaaS idea via form or chat interface
   * AI parses description and extracts product intent, target user, and value proposition

2. **Feature Mapping**

   * AI categorizes suggested features into *Core*, *Nice-to-Have*, and *Future*

3. **Tech Stack Recommendation**

   * AI recommends stack based on idea type, scale, and budget (e.g., Next.js + Supabase for MVP)

4. **Timeline & Complexity Estimation**

   * AI provides estimated build time (2–8 weeks range) and notes key trade-offs

5. **Risk Assessment**

   * Detects potential product, technical, or execution risks (e.g., scalability, data handling, unclear target market)

6. **Project Report Generation**

   * Founder can view or download full project report (Markdown or PDF)

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. MVP launched in **3 weeks**
2. Average API response under **8 seconds** per query
3. Works on Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Edge
4. Handles up to **500 idea submissions/day**
5. Logs user sessions for debugging (non-PII)
6. Scalable on Vercel for public demos

---

## Data Flow

1. User inputs SaaS idea
2. API sends prompt to OpenAI → receives structured response
3. System parses response into sections: Summary, Features, Stack, Risks, Timeline
4. Data displayed in UI → user can export report
5. (Optional) Saved to DB for registered users

---

## Dependencies

* **OpenAI API** – Idea analysis, stack recommendation, and report generation
* **Drizzle ORM** – Schema and database management
* **Inngest** – Background job handling for long tasks
* **shadcn/ui** – Component library for consistent UI
* **Vercel** – Hosting & deployment
* **Better Auth** – Authentication (future integration)

---

## Timeline

**Week 1** – Project setup, UI layout, idea input flow, API integration (OpenAI)
**Week 2** – Response structuring, PDF export, report generation
**Week 3** – Testing, styling polish, deployment to Vercel

---

## Future Enhancements

* Save project drafts to database
* Founder dashboard (view all reports)
* Collaboration tools for co-founders or dev partners
* Stripe payments for premium AI runs
* Integration with job boards / dev partners
* Custom AI model fine-tuned for SaaS evaluation

---

## Installation

#### 1. Clone Repository

Would you like me to also write a **shorter version** (e.g., GitHub-friendly 1-pager) for your public repo, and keep this one as the internal README for the project docs folder?
