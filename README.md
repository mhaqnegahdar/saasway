## What is SaaSWayz?

SaaSWayz replaces expensive ($500-$2,500) and time-consuming (1-2 weeks) strategy consulting with real-time AI voice calls that deliver structured guidance in hours, not weeks.

**Two call types:**

- **Clarity Call** ‚Äì Validates your idea and recommends: Build / Adjust / Validate More
- **Strategy Call** ‚Äì Translates your validated idea into a PRD + Technical Proposal

**Key Features:**

- Real-time voice interaction with expert AI
- Automated PRD and Technical Proposal generation
- Chat with AI across all project data (vector search)
- Document iteration via conversational updates
- Version history for all documents

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js 15, React 19, Shadcn, TailwindCSS
- **Backend:** tRPC, NeonDB + pgvector, Drizzle ORM
- **AI:** OpenAI Realtime API, GPT-4, text-embedding-3-small
- **Auth:** BetterAuth
- **Payments:** Polar
- **Real-time:** Stream SDK, Ingest Agent Kit
